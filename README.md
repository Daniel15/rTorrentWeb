rTorrentWeb is a Web GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the high-performance rTorrent torrent 
client. It is open-source (licensed under the GNU GPL version 3), and is written in the PHP 
programming language. This site is currently under construction, but a beta version of rTorrentWeb
is available. This is the **first** public release, so there **will** be bugs and problems. Feel 
free to create a ticket if you encounter a bug.
